# Overview

I used this project as an opportunity to learn how to code in Rust. After getting into classes I realized that this probably isn't the best coding language for the project I made

My project is a text based game engine. I built it on the premise of allowing game makers an easy way to populate a world and story without having to know code.
The game engine is built using a numbering system for each of the rooms, North and South move the rooms up/down 100, and East and West move the rooms up/down 1,
as displayed in the rooms' folder of this project. The game engine is built to replicate the Zork games.

The reason I wrote this code was to get a general understanding of the syntax of Rust. I built a program I had made in the past in python so that I could primarily focus on learning.

# Development Environment

* I used IntelliJ as my IDE by downloading a rust extension (Don't forget to install Rust directly to your computer)

* I used the Rust language I used the std::fs, and the std::io::stdin libraries. The fs one was for reading files, and the stdin was for retrieving user input

# Future Work

* I want a function that is built to populate the text files in the correct format for the game engine to read.
* I need to make classes for enemies and objects.
* Print out the data in a better format for the user.
